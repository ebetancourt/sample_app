# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application (and actually the main application)

This is the first application for [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com)

I am creating the project in such a way that I can re-use this repository for the principle project of the book,
a twitter clone.
